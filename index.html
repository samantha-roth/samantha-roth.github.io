title: "About Me"
---

I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at the Penn State Department of Statistics. 
My interests lie at the intersection of statistics and climate change issues.
Specifically, I am interested in computer model calibration, uncertainty quantification, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms,
environmental statistics, spatial/spatiotemporal statistics, climate science, and high performance computing.
I am co-advised by Murali Haran and Klaus Keller.
